## I. **Summary**
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

LitmusChaos is a tool that enables SREs and developers to find a weakness in their
deployments by running chaos experiments in the staging environment to find and detect
bugs and vulnerabilities.
The Litmus Portal provides a graphical user interface and is the console from which to
manage, monitor, and send events around the chaos workflows.

We need to develop a Terraform provider to provision LitmusChaos. Publish it as a provider at Terraform Registry. Utilize the API provider to run chaos workflows and add Chaoshub to ChaosCenter.
</div>

---

## II. **Description of the Problem**
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

In this project, we will develop a Terraform provider on top of the [Helm provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/latest/docs) to provision Litmus with the different operations. This provider will enable developers to install chaos center on k8s and chaos agent using Terraform scripts. Also, help to add chaoshub to ChaosCenter and run chaos workflows via API provider.
We will need to add tests before publishing the terraform provider. The provider documentation should be written and published as a Terraform provider at Terraform Registry.
</div>

<br>

### 2.1.1 Terraform

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It is a declarative language that describes the desired state of infrastructure as a set of configuration files. Terraform is used to provision infrastructure, change infrastructure, and manage infrastructure. Terraform uses **Terraform providers** to assign resources based on Terraform scripts. Terraform Scripts uses a declarative language developed by Hashicorp known as *Hashicorp Configuration Language*.
There are multiple use cases for this tool
 - Multi-Cloud Deployment
 - Application Infrastructure Deployment, Scaling, and Monitoring Tools
 - Self-Service Clusters
 - Kubernetes on different providers
 - PaaS Application Setup

 </div>

### 2.1.2 Terraform Providers 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Terraform providers are a set of tools that Terraform can use to provision infrastructure. Terraform providers are written in **Go** and are written in a way that is easy to use and maintain. All of the official providers can be found on the Hashicorp registry [(Here)](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers) and can be used by developers to build and maintain infrastructure using Terraform Scripts. </br>


</div>

### 2.2 Current Approach
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Currently, LitmusChaos has no official Terraform Provider. If an SRE or DevOps Engineer has to deploy a resource with Litmuschaos using terraform scripts. The options are:
- Use Helm Provider to install Litmuschaos on k8s and chaos center using terraform scripts.
- Use Kubernetes Provider to do the same.
- Manually install LitmusChaos on the resources. 
  
There might be some other options as well. But most of them require manual intervention. None of them are suitable for SREs to Create, Read, Update and Delete LitmusChaos-based resources using Terraform Scripts. There is a need to develop a Terraform provider to provision LitmusChaos on Kubernetes using scripts.

</div>

<br>

## III. **Proposed Solution**

<!-- The *schema.Provider type describes the provider's properties including:
the configuration keys it accepts
the resources it supports
any callbacks to configure -->
<!-- https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/1204?parent=catalog-->

### 3.1 **Making a Terraform Provider**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

In Terraform, a **Provider** is the logical abstraction of an upstream API. Terraform supports a plugin model, and all providers are actually plugins. Plugins are distributed as Go binaries. Although technically it is possible to write a plugin in another language, we will be going ahead with Go for this project.

There are a few reasons to use Terraform plugins. One of them is to provide a way to write Terraform scripts that are not supported by the official Terraform providers. The stats on Terraform registry are huge. A few official providers have over 10 million downloads per week. Terraform allows resources to begin managing existing infrastructure components once they migrate to Terraform. Lots of operators will bring their existing infrastructure under Terraform's control.



> *Rationale behind using Golang*. </br>
Almost all Terraform plugins are written in Go. Most of the code in LitmusChaos runs on Golang. Golang is great for scaling and concurrent programming.

 <u>**Implementation Details** </u>

Any Terraform Provider has four most basic parts: <br>
  i. The Provider Schema <br>
  ii. The Executable file <br>
  iii. Defining Resources <br>
  iv. CRUD Operations <br>

</div>

### 3.1.1 **The Provider Schema**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

 <!-- <span style="color:green ; font-family:Inconsolata"> -->
Schema is used to define attributes and their behaviors, using a high-level package exposed by Terraform Core named ```schema.Providers``` , Resources, and Provisioners all contain schemas and Terraform Core uses them to produce a plan and apply executions based on the behaviors described. 

This schema is a collection of key-value pairs of schema elements. The attributes a user can specify in their Terraform scripts. The keys are strings, and the values are ```schema.Schema``` structs that define the behavior.

In our solution, we will use the ``` schema.Provider``` type to define the provider's properties. We can have multiple properties as per the requirements. The minimum requirement is to have a ```kubeconfig``` property. It will tell the provider where to find the Kubernetes cluster. The ```kubeconfig``` property is a string that is the path to the kubeconfig file. There are other properties that can be specified. We may also have a struct of all the necessary parameters for the provider schema.

The schema takes care of the arguments that are supplied to it within the Terraform script. The schema will also be used to validate the arguments supplied to it. But the schema is not an executable file. It is a simple collection of key-value pairs.

An example of proposed schema is:

``` package sample_provider
import (
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema"
)

func Provider() *schema.Provider {
    return &schema.Provider{

		ResourcesMap: map[string]*schema.Resource{
            "example_server": resourceServer(),
		},

        Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
            "kubeconfig": {
                Type:        schema.TypeString,
                Required:    true,
            },
            "kubeconfig_content": {
                Type:        schema.TypeString,
                Optional:    true,
                Default:     "",
            }
        },

		ConfigureFunc: func(d *schema.ResourceData) (interface{}, error) {
			return &config{
				kubeconfig:        d.Get("kubeconfig").(string),
				kubeconfigContent: d.Get("kubeconfig_content").(string),
					}, nil
				},
    }
}
```
</div>

### 3.1.2 **The Executable file**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Go requires a ```main.go``` file, which is the default executable when the binary is built. The ```main.go``` file is the entry point of the program. It can be the only file that is required to be present in a plugin. Since Terraform plugins are distributed as Go binaries, it is important to define this entry-point file.
We can also include the schema in the ```main.go``` file. But to maintain the simplicity and readability of the code, we will define the schema in a separate file.

<br><br><br>

A sample ```main.go``` file for proposed terraform provider:
<br>

```
package main
import (
        "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/plugin"
        "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/terraform"
)
func main() {
        plugin.Serve(&plugin.ServeOpts{
                ProviderFunc: func() terraform.ResourceProvider {
                        return Provider()
                },
        })
} 
```
This establishes the main function to produce a valid, executable Go binary. The contents of the main function consume Terraform's plugin library. This library deals with all the communication between Terraform core and the plugin.

We initiate the module, download and install the dependencies. Next, build the plugin using the Go toolchain. Verify the results by executing.

```go build -o litmuschaos-provider ./main.go```

Next, we have to define the resources. 

</div>

### 3.2 **DeÔ¨Åning Resources with CRUD**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

A resource is a component of the terraform provider. 
Defining the ability to **create, read, update,** and **delete** resources is an important part of creating Terraform Providers. Terraform lifecycle operations are mapped into API operations. And resources are the final outcome of the Terraform script.

> As an example, the Google provider supports ```google_compute_instance``` and ```google_compute_address```.

General convention is that Terraform providers put each resource in their own file, named after the resource, prefixed with ```resource_```.

A sample resource file looks like this:

```
package main
import (
        "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/helper/schema"
)
func resourceServer() *schema.Resource {

        return &schema.Resource{
                Create: resourceServerCreate,
                Read:   resourceServerRead,
                Update: resourceServerUpdate,
                Delete: resourceServerDelete,
                },
        }
}
```

We will be defining these functions to explain the logic behind the provisioning of the resource as per the Terraform Scripts.
Helm will be called in these functions to initiate and manage litmuschaos on the resources.
<br>

</div>

### 3.2.1 **Create**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

The function will be called in the case of ```Terraform apply```.
It will create the ```litmus``` namespace and install the helm chart in it. 
There is a pre-requisite that Helm needs to be installed on the cluster. We could have another validation step to check if the helm is installed or not. 

We will be using the ```client-go``` library to create the namespace.

```
nsSpec := &v1.Namespace{ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{Name: "litmus"}}
_, err := clientset.Core().Namespaces().Create(nsSpec)
```
We will use the official Helm dependency to install the ```litmus``` chart. This is a small snippet that will be a part of **Create** :

```
chart, err := loader.Load("https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus-helm/")
 iCli := action.NewInstall(actionConfig)
    iCli.Namespace = "litmus"
    rel, err := iCli.Run(chart, nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("Successfully installed LitmusChaos")
```

</div>

<br>

### 3.2.2 **Read**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

This function will read the ```litmus``` namespace and check if the ```litmus``` namespace is created or not. We will accomplish this using the ```client-go``` library.

```
_, err := clientset.Core().Namespaces().Get("litmus", metav1.GetOptions{})

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Litmus Namespace exists")
```

This function will act as a validation step. If the namespace is not created, it will return an error. It might call back the **Create** function in the case of an error. We might also check for the other resources in the ```litmus``` namespace. We can have a check to see if all the important Kubernetes components for Chaos are present or not. 
We can have checks for these resources:
- chaos-exporter 
- chaos-operator-metrics 
- litmuschaos-frontend-service
- litmuschaos-server-service
- litmusportal-frontend-service 

This might also be called after the steps of the **Delete** function to validate the destruction of all resources.

</div>

### 3.2.3 **Update**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

This function will also have a similar format of dependencies. The function will have multiple parameters as per the use case. The function would manage the components in the ```litmus``` namespace.

If needed we can also have dependencies other than ```client-go``` to help us run *kubectl* commands directly like in a terminal.
We can call **Read** Function internally to measure the difference between the current configs and the requested changes.

 A checker for the difference between the requested resources and the existing resources. This will have a logging system setup to have a history of the changes. This will help the developers to understand the changes.

This is a user-specific function and has to be discussed.

### 3.2.4 **Delete**

This function will be used in the case of a ```terraform destroy``` operation. It will delete the ```litmus``` namespace and all the resources in it. It will delete all the components in the ```litmus``` namespace. We could use either ```client-go``` or ```kubectl``` to delete the resources. We will callback the **Read** function to check if the namespace and other components are deleted or not.

</div>

### 3.3 **Using API Provider to add chaoshub and run Chaos workflows** 

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

The Litmus Portal API Provider is based on GraphQL. It can be used to create and manage chaosworkflows and more. Documentation can be found [Here](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/graphql/v2.0.0/api.html).

Before running any type of mutation on the GraphQL API, we need to authenticate the user. We will be creating a JWT Token first by hitting the ```Auth server```. The ```POST``` request will have the following parameters in the Body:

```
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "litmus"
}
```
We will be using this JWT Token to authenticate the user on GraphQL API. Once the user is authenticated, we can use the API Provider to run and add chaos on our cluster. We can follow the steps from [Here](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/graphql/v2.0.0/api.html#operation-create_chaosworkflow-post).

</div>

### 3.4 **Testing and Publishing Terraform Provider**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Publishing the Terraform Provider is a very important step.
Terraform has very well-written steps to help developers publish providers [Here](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/publishing). We will need to complete two more steps to publish the Terraform Provider.
Any terraform provider needs these two things to get published:

- Test Cases
- Documentation

</div>

### 3.4.1 **Test Cases**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

We will need to have code to test the terraform provider. We will be referring to this Documentation [Here](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/testing/acceptance-tests/testcase) to create the test cases.

Terraform‚Äôs ```resource``` package offers a method Test(), accepting two parameters that act as the entry point to Terraform‚Äôs acceptance test framework. The basic two parameters of these functions are:
- The standard ```*testing.T ``` struct from Golang‚Äôs Testing package. [Here](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T)
- ``` TestCase```, a Go struct that developers use to set up the acceptance tests. [Here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/resource#TestCase)

This section will require a lot of work. We will be creating the test cases for the terraform provider. We will have to handle error handling in these files. Also, will take care of partial states.

TestCase offers several fields for developers to add to customize and validate each test, defined below.

- **IsUnitTest** : It allows a test to run regardless of the TF_ACC environment variable.
- **PreCheck** : It is commonly used to verify that required values exist for testing, such as environment variables containing test keys that are used to configure the Provider or Resource under test.
- **Providers**: In our case, this is the most important test case. Only the Providers included in this map are loaded during the test, so any Provider included in a configuration file for testing must be represented in this map or the test will fail during initialization. 
- **Steps**: Basic tests typically contain one to two steps, to verify the resource can be created and subsequently updated, depending on the properties of the resource. In general, simply creating/destroying tests will only need one step.
- **CheckDestroy**: It is called after all test steps have been run and Terraform has run destroy on the remaining state.

Here is a sample test case for the provider:

```
package litmusTest

func TestLitmus(t *testing.T) {
  var clusterBefore, clusterAfter litmusTest.Widget

    resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{

    // check for  litmus namespace and the resources within
    PreCheck:     func() { SimpleBaiscTests(t) },

    // check for litmusProvider
    Providers:  litmuschaos-provider,

    // destroys all the rest tests, executes at the end
    CheckDestroy: testAccCheckExampleResourceDestroy,

    // we define each step for testing
    Steps: []resource.TestStep{
      {
        Config: TestClusterResource(clusterBefore),
        Check: resource.ComposeTestCheckFunc(
          test_for_litmus_exist(&ClusterBefore),
        ),
      },
      {
        Config: TestClusterResource(clusterAfter),
        Check: resource.ComposeTestCheckFunc(
          testAccCheckExampleResourceExists(&clusterAfter),
        ),
      },
    },
  })
}


```
>  We might add more functions and steps as per the requirements.

</div>

### 3.4.2 **Documentation**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Terraform helps to develop and maintain the documentation for our provider with each release. There is a tool that helps to generate the documentation for the terraform provider. We will be using this tool to generate the documentation for the terraform provider.

More on this can be found in the documentation at Terraform [Here](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/docs).


### 3.4.3 **Publishing Provider**

We can publish and share a provider by signing into the Registry using our GitHub account and following a few additional steps.
Only after publishing the provider on Terraform registry will help Developers utilise it in their Terraform scripts.
More info is in the documentation : [Here](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/publishing)

</div>

### 3.5  **Dependencies**

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

There are official Golang dependencies of Terraform that will use in this:

```

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

* Objective is to push a good number of Pull Requests to the LitmsChaos GitHub repository.
* Completing the already assigned tasks. I have worked on some features on the project, will try to complete it as soon as possible.
 * Take a course on Terraform.Refer and study the GitHub repos of various official terraform providers.
 
</div>

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-LpTEGk8J9pnuuDdHDcN_CsbTW1Kyj6E" alt="drawing" style="width:440px;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> </img>

<br>

### 1. **Community Bonding Period** ( May 20 - June 12 )

#### 1.1 Week 1:

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

* Contact the Litmuschaos Developers (Raj, Vedant, Ajeesh, and others), and try to get in touch with them.
* Get in touch with my project mentor, introduce myself, and work out a good time to communicate (taking into account their schedule).
* Ask the mentor for any suggestions/changes to the project. The project proposal reflects my knowledge of writing, there may be essential amendments necessary and it would be better to make them early.

</div>

#### 1.2 Week 2:

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

* Go through the Litmuschaos codebase again. Make notes of all the parameters needed to install the project on a Kubernetes cluster.
* Go through some of the examples of terraform providers. Discuss the different approaches taken by other providers took, so it is essential to get familiar with them.
* Get in touch with other GSoCers, both within the CNCF community and outside.

</div>

#### 1.3 Week 3:

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

* Terraform in itself is a pretty detailed tool for Infrastructure as a Code. To make a Terraform provider would require me to learn and implement the tools as well. So going through the Terraform documentation is essential.
* Discover the current approaches to installing LitmusChaos on a Cluster (local/hosted). Want to look into options of:
    - Write Terraform script to install Litmuschaos using Helm Provider.
    - Use Kubernetes provider to install LitmusChaos using helm charts.
* Once tested the other methods, we will keep a note of the shortcomings in each approach. We will be using them to improve the overall performance of the project later.

</div>


### 2. **Phase 1** (June 13 - July 29)

#### 2.1 Week 4:

<div style="text-align: justify">
